Tutorial 1 (HMI data ananysis)
*******************************

Importing and ploting data
==========================

Solar active regions are patches of highly dense magnetic fields seen on the solar surface. Routine observations of the active regions is done usng versons ground-based and space-borne instruments. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (`HMI <http://hmi.stanford.edu/>`_) on board Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) provides different magnetic field data products. 

We will download some of the active region data ad plot them using `SunPy <https://sunpy.org/>`_.
